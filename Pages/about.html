            Up to 30% of abdominal surgeries are complicated by incisional or ventral hernia. 
            These hernias can grow in size over time, cause strangulation of the colon, have 
            considerable pain, and be cosmetically unappealing. Hernias often require surgery 
            to fix, with the insertion of mesh support. Biologic and other solid meshes are becoming 
            increasingly popular for hernia mesh repair and have been found to be better for patient 
            outcomes. However, current surgical staplers cannot affix solid biological meshes, forcing 
            surgeons to tediously suture the meshes.

            TauTona Group has recently developed an innovative technology and design that allows surgeons 
            to perform procedures with greater speed, efficiency, and precision. We have developed the 
            BioBolt Surgical Stapler that can pierce, manipulate, and fix a variety of meshes and tissues 
            with the speed of a stapler and the strength of a suture. This device is specifically designed 
            for hernia repair, allowing surgeons to attach all meshes, including solid meshes, to human 
            tissue with minimal time, reducing a 30-60 minutes suturing process to just 5 minutes. Our 
            extensive testing has shown that tissue pull out strength with BioBolt is not only equivalent 
            in strength with suturing, but also better in consistency. Furthermore, this technology 
            eliminates the need for sharp or metal fixation devices with closed staple loops, minimizing 
            the risks of tissue damage, ischemia, and adhesions. The simple and easy-to-use design 
            of the BioBolt device promises to enhance patient surgical outcomes, enable robotic 
            procedures, and eliminate knot tying, thus reducing the risk of biological/synthetic mesh tears.

            Not only is the BioBolt stapler expected to bring significant cost savings to the healthcare 
            system and patients, but it also has the potential to improve patient outcomes. By reducing 
            surgery and anesthesia time, patients are exposed to fewer risks and complications, which can 
            lead to quicker recovery times. Furthermore, the BioBolt stapler offers a minimally invasive 
            alternative to traditional suturing and stitching techniques, which can result in less 
            scarring, pain and bleeding, as well as a more comfortable recovery experience. As such, the 
            BioBolt stapler is not only a cost-efficient solution, but also a patient-centric one, which 
            will have a positive impact on the overall healthcare experience.
